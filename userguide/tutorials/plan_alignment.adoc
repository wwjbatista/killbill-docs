= Plan Alignments

== Overview

In the Kill Bill model, `Subscriptions` are associated to a `Plan` (defined in the catalog), and `Plans` are made of several `PlanPhases`.
The idea behind the model is to accurately represent the transitions from different phases (e.g `TRIAL` -> `EVERGREEN`) without having the system/user to take any actions:
Subscriptions automatically transition from one `PlanPhase` to the next, as defined by the shape of the `Plan` and the clock moving forward.

When changing the `Plan` associated to a subscription (e.g upgrade), the system needs to understand how to align phases from original `Plan` to new `Plan` to make sure the user ends up in the right phase. Let's consider the following example with two similar `Plans` (`silver-monthly` and `gold-monthly`) both containing two phases, namely a 7 days `TRIAL` phase, followed by a monthly `EVERGREEN` (recurring forever until cancelled) phase.

* On january 1st, subscription is initially created with a `silver-monthly` `Plan`, and starts with the 7 days `TRIAL` period.
* On january 4th, while the subscription is still in `TRIAL`, the user upgrades to a `gold-monthly` plan.

As a company offering those plans, you have the choice to define the behavior of such operation:

1. You may want to restart a full 7 days `TRIAL` period (the `Plan` being different, one way want the user to have a fully 7 days period to experiment)
2. You may want to offer the remaining of the `TRIAL` period (4 days left)
3. You may want to skip the `TRIAL` altogether (The user already made up his mind he liked the product and upgraded to `gold-monthly` so he is already committed).

In order to provide this level of flexibility, the catalog contains alignement rules to specify such behaviors.

Such alignement rules exist both for operations that create `Subscription` (to decide on how to align Add-On `Plan` with respect to the `Base` `Plan`) and also, as mentionned in the previous example for change `Plan` operations.
The http://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html#_subscription_alignment_rules[Kill Bill Subscription Guide] provides an overview of such alignments.


In addition to specifying alignment policies, our apis also allow to specify a target `PlanPhase`. The specification of such target `PlanPhase` can be used when creating a new `Subscription` or when changing `Plan`. With the previously defined `gold-monthly` plan, we could create a subscription with a target `PlanPhase` set to `EVERGREEN` to make sure the user skips the `TRIAL` phase and directly starts on `EVERGREEN` phase. Note that this is also achievable by creating more `Plan` entries in the catalog (e.g a `gold-monthly-notrial` `Plan`), but this would force administrators to duplicate the plans and may also be an issue from an analytics point of view (depending on which/how metrics are being computed).

The rest of this documentation will look at various scenarii to understand the impact of `Plan` alignment and ability to skip `PlanPhase`.

== Scenarii

=== Subscription Creation with Target PlanPhase specified

In this section we look at the behavior of the system when a change `Plan` operation happens on a Subscription for which initial phase(s) were skipped at creation (by specifying a target `PlanPhase`).

==== Scenario 1a

In this scenario, the `Plan` for the original `Subscription` was made of 2 `PlanPhases`, namely a `TRIAL` and an `EVERGREEN` phase, and the user skipped the `TRIAL` by **specifying the `EVERGREEN` target `PlanPhase`**. Later, a change of `Plan` to another `Plan` containing one or more `PlanPhase` happens, with its (last) `PlanPhase` being `EVERGREEN` and **the catalog was configured to use a `START_OF_SUBSCRIPTION` (or `START_OF_BUNDLE`) plan change alignment**.

We can see that we realigned based on the date of the start of `Subscription` and **matched** the same target `PlanPhase` that was originally specified when creating the `Subscription`.


==== Scenario 1b

This scenario is similar to the previous one except for **the catalog that was configured to use a `CHANGE_OF_PLAN` plan change alignment**.

We can see that we realigned based on the date of the change `Plan` operation and we ignore the original target `PlanPhase` that was originally specified when creating the `Subscription`. We will see in a subsequent scenario that if the intent is to stay on `EVERGREEN` we can also specify a target `PlanPhase` when making the change operation.


==== Scenario 2a


In this scenario, the `Plan` for the original `Subscription` was made of 2 `PlanPhases`, namely a `TRIAL` and an `EVERGREEN` phase, and the user skipped the `TRIAL` by **specifying the `EVERGREEN` target `PlanPhase`**. Later, a change of `Plan` to another `Plan` containing one or more `PlanPhase` happens, but such `Plan` does not include an `EVERGREEN` `PlanPhase` (the original target `PlanPhase` specified at creation time). **The catalog was configured to use a `START_OF_SUBSCRIPTION` (or `START_OF_BUNDLE`) plan change alignment**.

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/alignments/PlanAlignmentScenario2a.png[align=center]

We can see that we realigned based on the date of the start of `Subscription` but because the original target `PlanPhase` **does not exist** in the `Plan` we realigned using the first `PlanPhase` of the new `Plan`.

==== Scenario 2b

This scenario is similar to the previous one except for **the catalog that was configured to use a `CHANGE_OF_PLAN` plan change alignment**.

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/alignments/PlanAlignmentScenario2b.png[align=center]

We can see that we realigned based on the date of the change `Plan` operation and also start from the first `PlanPhase` of the new `Plan`.


=== Plan Change with Target PlanPhase


In this section we look at the behavior of the system when the user specifies a target `PlanPhase` on  a change `Plan` operation.

==== Scenario 1a

In this scenario we assume that a `Subscription` was created using a `Plan` made of 2 `PlanPhases`, namely a `TRIAL` and an `EVERGREEN` phase, and the user **did not skip any `PlanPhase`**. Subsequently, the user issues a change `Plan` operation with a new `Plan` that has 3 `PlanPhases`, namely  a `TRIAL`, a `DISCOUNT` and an `EVERGREEN` phase. The user specifies a `DISCOUNT` target `PlanPhase` when changing the `Plan`. **The catalog was configured to use a `START_OF_SUBSCRIPTION` (or `START_OF_BUNDLE`) plan change alignment**.


image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/alignments/PlanAlignmentScenarioChange1a.png[align=center]

We can see that we realigned based on the date of the start of `Subscription` and because the change `Plan` operation specified a `DISCOUNT` target `PlanPhase`, we realign based on that `PlanPhase`.

==== Scenario 1b

This scenario is similar to the previous one except for **the catalog that was configured to use a `CHANGE_OF_PLAN` plan change alignment**.


image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/alignments/PlanAlignmentScenarioChange1b.png[align=center]

We can see that we realigned based on the date of the change `Plan` operation and also start with the specified `DISCOUNT` target `PlanPhase`.


== Summary

The use of aligment rules (as configured in the catalog) along with the ability to specify target `PlanPhase` when creating a `Subscription` or changing the `Plan` of an existing `Subscription` provides users with a lot of flexibility.

This documentation has shown some basic scenarii that should provide the knowledge to achieve the desired result. However, the number of use cases to cover is quite large, and dependent of each catalog and business logic, so we strongly advise to experiment (and write tests specifc to each use case).
